1) cargo build -> compiles the rust code and puts executable in target/debug
2) cargo new folderName -> makes a cargo development 
3) cargo check -> only compiles 
4) cargo run -> compiles and runs executable in one step 
5) cargo build --release -> slow compilation time but fast executable for production
